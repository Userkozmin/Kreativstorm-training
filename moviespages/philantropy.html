    <h1>Philanthropy</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Ovidiu Gorea is just a poor teacher when he meets a captivating but
      materialistic young beauty, Diana. To keep up with his ladylove's lust for
      luxury, Ovidiu seeks a way to earn quick cash and so falls in league with
      a shady network of con men. With the help of fellow grifter, Miruna,
      Ovidiu is soon scoring money and free meals all over Bucharest, Romania.
      However, things get complicated when Miruna falls for her partner in
      crime.
