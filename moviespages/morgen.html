    <p>
      A low-key satire that takes a droll approach to the serious subject of
      illegal immigration.This film is about a poor farmer called Nelu, who
      lives near the border with his wife Florica in a broken-down house. Nelu
      works as a mall security-guard, well-known and liked by the people in the
      town. But Nelu is bored with his life, and is very annoyed at the arrogant
      border-guards, who harass him whenever he has been across the border to
      catch fish.
